Heap
Heap by default orders least element on top

* Comparator
    compareTo():
    The semantics of the return values are:

    - A negative value means that the first object was smaller than second object.
    - The value 0 means the two objects are equal.
    - A positive value means that the first object was larger than the second object.

    - compareTo(int o1, int o2){ return o1-o2} makes min heap
    - compareTo(int o1, int o2){ return o2-o1} makes max heap

* Comparable
    compare(Object o):
    - An int value: 0 if the string is equal to the other string.
    - < 0 if the string is lexicographically less than the other string
    - > 0 if the string is lexicographically greater than the other string (more characters)
